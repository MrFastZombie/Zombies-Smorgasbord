description = "This mod allows you to generate LODs for viewing past your render distance. If you must use one or the other I recommend using Acedium/Nvidium if possible, but they can work together. If usinng both, you shoudld disable Distant Generation and increase the LOD distance. Distant Horizons is great with Acedium/Nvidium as it will allow you to see even further. May cause stuttering when loading chunks on weak CPUs."
